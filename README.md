[![l10n](https://i18n.elementary.io/widgets/desktop/capnet-assist/svg-badge.svg)](https://i18n.elementary.io/projects/desktop/capnet-assist)

A small WebKit app only to make a user log in when a captive portal is detected.

Set the environment variable G_MESSAGES_DEBUG to "all" to have the captive-login binary print debug messages.
